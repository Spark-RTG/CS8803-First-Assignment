To-do List Android application

Since our backend API is deployed on AWS, you can’t directly access the APIs. We’ve uploaded all code for lambda functions (RESTful APIs) in the repo under the app/backend directory.

You can put the entire folder inside Android Studio to build and run the application, or you can directly download the apk inside the app/release directory.
